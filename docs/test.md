# 🧪 Testing & Verification Guide

Use this guide to verify that **every assignment requirement** is met. Run through each section systematically.

---

## Prerequisites

Open **two terminals** in the project root:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Trigger.dev worker
npx trigger.dev@latest dev
```

Make sure your `.env` has all keys configured:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSLOADIT_AUTH_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TRANSLOADIT_TEMPLATE_ID`
- `TRIGGER_SECRET_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`

| 9.7 | Persistence | Refresh page | Run history still present (loaded from DB) |

**File**: `src/components/workflow/HistorySidebar.tsx`

---

## 10. Export/Import JSON

| # | Test | How to Verify | Expected |
|---|------|---------------|----------|
| 10.1 | Export | Click SHARE button in header | Downloads `workflow_name.json` file |
| 10.2 | Import | *(See note below)* | — |

> ⚠️ **Note**: JSON import (uploading a `.json` file to restore a workflow) may not have a dedicated UI button. The current implementation only has JSON **export** via the Share button. If the evaluator tests import, you may need to add an import button to the Header.

## 14. Pulsating Glow Effect

| Node | Has Glow? | Triggered By |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| LLM Node | ✅ | `data.status === "loading"` |
| Crop Image | ✅ | `data.status === "loading"` |
| Extract Frame | ✅ | `data.status === "loading"` |
| Text Node | N/A | (instant, no async processing) |
| Image Node | N/A | (upload is synchronous) |
| Video Node | N/A | (upload is synchronous) |

**CSS**: `animate-pulse` with `border-[#dfff4f] shadow-[0_0_30px_rgba(223,255,79,0.3)]`

---

## ⚠️ Known Gaps to Address

1. **JSON Import** — Only export (Share) is implemented. Consider adding a file upload button in the Header to import `.json` workflow files.
2. **Zod Validation** — Not found in API routes or server actions. Add Zod schemas for workflow save/run payloads if time permits.
3. **Trigger.dev Worker** — Must be running (`npx trigger.dev@latest dev`) for ANY node execution to work. Without it, workflows will get stuck.
4. **Transloadit Template** — Must be manually created at [transloadit.com](https://transloadit.com) with a file upload step. Without it, image/video uploads will fail.
