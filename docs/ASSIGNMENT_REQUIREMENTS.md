## 6. Workflow History (Right Sidebar)

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| History Panel | Right sidebar showing list of all workflow runs |
| Execution Scope | History tracks all execution types: full workflow runs, single node runs, and selected node group runs |
| Run Entry | Each entry shows: timestamp, status (success/failed/partial), duration, and scope (full/partial/single) |
| Click to Expand | Clicking a run shows **node-level execution details** |
| Node-Level History | For each node: status, inputs used, outputs generated, execution time |
| Partial Runs | Show which nodes ran successfully even if workflow failed |
| Visual Indicators | Color-coded status badges (green=success, red=failed, yellow=running) |
| Persistence | All history must persist to PostgreSQL database |

### Node-Level History View Example

When clicking on a workflow run, display:
```
Run #123 - Jan 14, 2026 3:45 PM (Full Workflow)

├── Text Node (node-1) ✅ 0.1s
│   └── Output: "Generate a product description..."
│
├── Image Node (node-2) ✅ 2.3s
│   └── Output: https://cdn.transloadit.com/...
│
├── Crop Image (node-3) ✅ 1.8s
│   └── Output: https://cdn.transloadit.com/...
│
├── LLM Node (node-4) ✅ 4.2s
│   └── Output: "Introducing our premium..."
│
└── Extract Frame (node-5) ❌ Failed
    └── Error: "Invalid timestamp parameter"
```

## 7. Workflow Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Drag & Drop Nodes | Add nodes from sidebar to canvas via click or drag |
| Node Connections | Connect output handles to input handles with animated edges |
| Configurable Inputs | All node parameters must be configurable via input handles OR manual entry |
| Connected Input State | When an input handle has a connection, disable the corresponding manual input field (greyed out) — value comes from connected node |
| Type-Safe Connections | Enforce type-safe connections: image nodes cannot connect to prompt/system prompt inputs, text outputs cannot connect to file inputs — invalid connections must be visually disallowed |
| DAG Validation | Workflows must be DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph); circular loops/cycles should not be allowed |
| Node Deletion | Delete nodes via menu button or keyboard (Delete/Backspace) |
| Canvas Navigation | Pan (drag background), zoom (scroll wheel), fit view |
| MiniMap | Bottom-right corner navigation minimap |
| Undo/Redo | Implement undo/redo for node operations |
| Selective Execution | Allow users to run a single node, select multiple nodes, or run the entire workflow — each creates a history entry |
| Parallel Execution | Independent branches in the workflow DAG must execute concurrently — nodes only wait for their direct dependencies, not unrelated nodes |
| Workflow Persistence | Save/load workflows to PostgreSQL database |
| Export/Import | Workflow export/import as JSON |

## 8. Required Sample Workflow: "Product Marketing Kit Generator"

This workflow demonstrates all 6 node types with **parallel execution** and a **convergence point**. Two independent branches run simultaneously, then merge at a final node.

### Branch A: Image Processing + Product Description
**Nodes:** Upload Image, Crop Image, Text (×2), LLM Node #1

1. **Upload Image Node** — User uploads a product photo (jpg/png/webp)
2. **Crop Image Node** — Receives uploaded image, crops to focus on product (e.g., center crop at 80% width/height)
3. **Text Node #1 (System Prompt)** — Contains: *"You are a professional marketing copywriter. Generate a compelling one-paragraph product description."*
4. **Text Node #2 (Product Details)** — Contains: *"Product: Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Features: Noise cancellation, 30-hour battery, foldable design."*
5. **LLM Node #1** — Receives:
   - `system_prompt` ← Text Node #1
   - `user_message` ← Text Node #2
   - `images` ← Crop Image Node (cropped photo)
   - Outputs: AI-generated product description

### Branch B: Video Frame Extraction
**Nodes:** Upload Video, Extract Frame

1. **Upload Video Node** — User uploads a product demo video (mp4/mov/webm)
2. **Extract Frame from Video Node** — Receives:
   - `video_url` ← Upload Video Node
   - `timestamp` ← "50%" (extracts frame from middle of video)
   - Outputs: Extracted frame image URL

### Convergence Point: Final Marketing Summary
**Node:** LLM Node #2 (waits for BOTH branches)

- `system_prompt` ← Text Node #3: *"You are a social media manager. Create a tweet-length marketing post based on the product image and video frame."*
- `user_message` ← **LLM Node #1 output** (product description from Branch A)
- `images` ← Cropped product image (Branch A) + Extracted video frame (Branch B)
- Output: Final marketing tweet/post displayed inline on the node

### Execution Timeline

| Phase | Branch A | Branch B | Convergence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Upload Image + Text Nodes | Upload Video | — |
| Phase 2 | Crop Image Node | Extract Frame Node | — |
| Phase 3 | LLM Node #1 (waits for crop + texts) | *(complete)* | — |
| Phase 4 | *(complete)* | *(complete)* | LLM Node #2 (waits for both) |

## 9. Technical Specifications

### Project Stack (Required)

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Next.js+ | React framework with App Router |
| TypeScript | Type safety throughout the codebase |
| PostgreSQL | Database (Supabase, Neon, or similar) |
| Prisma | ORM for database access |
| Clerk | Authentication |
| React Flow | Visual workflow/node graph library |
| Trigger.dev | ALL node execution MUST use Trigger.dev |
| Transloadit | File uploads and media processing |
| FFmpeg | Image/video processing (via Trigger.dev) |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling (match Weavy's theme exactly) |
| Zustand | State management |
| Zod | Schema validation |
| Google Generative AI | `@google/generative-ai` package |
| Lucide React | Icon library |

### Trigger.dev Requirements

**Every node execution MUST be a Trigger.dev task.** This is non-negotiable.

| Node Type | Trigger.dev Task |
|---|---|
| LLM Node | Task that calls Gemini API |
| Crop Image | Task that runs FFmpeg crop operation |
| Extract Frame | Task that runs FFmpeg frame extraction |

### Parallel Task Execution
- Independent nodes (no dependencies between them) must be triggered concurrently
- Tasks should only await completion of their direct upstream dependencies
- Example: If Node A and Node B have no connection, trigger both tasks simultaneously rather than sequentially
